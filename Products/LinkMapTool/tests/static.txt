Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.LinkMapTool.LinkMapTool import LinkMapTool
    >>> LinkMapTool.id == 'portal_linkmap'
    True
    >>> LinkMapTool.meta_type == 'LinkMap Tool'
    True
